# Building REST API using AWS Chalice

This is a simple workshop to build REST API using [AWS Chalice](https://aws.github.io/chalice/). AWS Chalice is a framework for writing serverless apps in Python.  It provides:

* A command line tool for creating, deploying, and managing your app
* A decorator based API for integrating with [Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/), [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), [Amazon SNS](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/), [Amazon SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/), and other AWS services.
* Automatic IAM policy generation
* CI/CD pipeline generation
* Local testing support
* Native Python packaging
* [AWS SAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/what-is-sam.html) and [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) integration
